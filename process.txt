Process for pseudo-automatized & pseudo-realtime stitching:

0.- Start recording...
1.- Take picture:
    - save its mat file <- this will be the 1st image of the stitching final mat image
    - extract its keypoints by using ORB|FAST feature detector, save it
2.- Start tracking:
    - Estimate the actual position of current image in camera recording
    - Set its projected position
    - For fast performance:
        - use ORB|FAST feature detector
        - no stitching
        - no blending
3.- Wait for next taken picture
    If picture has being taken:
    Do camera image & saved image has inlines (matches) ?
        If not : replace saved image with current taken image
        If yes : parallely do:
            - replace saved image with map of current camera image & saved image (no stitched)
            - start new thread : in background begin process for stitch those two images
4.- While stitcher thread has not finished, continue tracking with actual
4.- Repeat 3.
